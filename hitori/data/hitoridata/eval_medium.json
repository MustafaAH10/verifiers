You think carefully about the problem step by step in your mind before providing the answer.\n\nUser: Solve this 6x6 Hitori puzzle:\n\n  A B C D E F\n1 1 5 3 5 6 2\n2 6 6 4 5 1 1\n3 6 3 1 6 5 4\n4 2 6 5 5 1 3\n5 1 1 1 4 2 1\n6 5 4 2 4 3 6\n\nRules:\n1. UNIQUENESS: Each number must appear only once per row and column (among unshaded/white cells)\n2. NON-ADJACENCY: No two shaded/black cells may be adjacent horizontally or vertically\n3. CONNECTIVITY: All unshaded/white cells must form a single connected region\n\nThink step-by-step about which cells must be shaded. Consider:\n- Which numbers appear multiple times in rows/columns (at least one copy must be shaded)\n- Which cells cannot be shaded without disconnecting white cells\n- Which cells cannot be shaded without creating adjacent black cells\n\nShow your reasoning in <think> </think> tags.\nReturn the cells to shade in <answer> </answer> tags using coordinate notation.\nExample: <answer>A1, B3, C5, F2</answer>\n\nAssistant: Let me solve this step by step.\n<think>",
