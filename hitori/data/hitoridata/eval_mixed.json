If a row has two 3s, at least one must be shaded\n- E.g. If a column has three 5s, at least two must be shaded\n\n### Rule 2: NON-ADJACENCY\nNo two shaded cells may touch each other horizontally or vertically (diagonal is OK).\n- E.g. If you shade A1, you CANNOT shade A2 or B1\n- Shaded cells must be isolated from each other orthogonally\n\n### Rule 3: CONNECTIVITY\nAll unshaded (white) cells must form a single connected region.\n- You must be able to travel from any unshaded cell to any other unshaded cell\n- Movement is only horizontal or vertical (not diagonal)\n- Shading cannot split the white cells into separate islands\n\n## Coordinate System\n- Columns are labeled A-F (left to right)\n- Rows are labeled R1-R6 (top to bottom), but use just the number in coordinates\n- Example: A1 = column A, row R1 (top-left), F6 = column F, row R6 (bottom-right)\n\n## Worked Example\n\nFor this 4x4 puzzle:\n     A  B  C  D\n   +-----------+\nR1 | 2  1  2  3 |\nR2 | 1  2  3  2 |\nR3 | 3  3  1  4 |\nR4 | 4  4  2  1 |\n   +-----------+\n\n<think>\nLet me identify the duplicates first:\n- Row R1: two 2s at A1 and C1 - one must be shaded\n- Row R2: two 2s at B2 and D2 - one must be shaded\n- Row R3: two 3s at A3 and B3 - one must be shaded\n- Row R4: two 4s at A4 and B4 - one must be shaded\n- Column C: two 2s at C1 and C4\n\nWorking through the logic:\n- If I shade A1 (value 2), then C1 stays unshaded\n- For Row R3: if I shade B3, then A3 stays\n- For Row R4: if I shade A4, then B4 stays (and A4 is not adjacent to B3)\n- For Row R2: if I shade D2, then B2 stays\n\nChecking solution A1, D2, B3, A4:\n- Adjacency: A1\u2194D2 (not adjacent \u2713), A1\u2194B3 (not adjacent \u2713), A1\u2194A4 (not adjacent, A2/A3 between \u2713)\n- D2\u2194B3 (not adjacent \u2713), D2\u2194A4 (not adjacent \u2713), B3\u2194A4 (not adjacent \u2713)\n- Connectivity: all unshaded cells form one connected region \u2713\n- Uniqueness: no duplicates in any row or column \u2713\n</think>\n<answer>A1, D2, B3, A4</answer>\n\n## Your Task\n\nSolve the 6x6 puzzle above.
